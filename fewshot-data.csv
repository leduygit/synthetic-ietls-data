1,"There is a lot of pressure on young people today to succeed academically. As a result,
some people believe that non-academic subjects, such as physical education and cookery,
should be removed from the school syllabus so that children can concentrate on academic
work.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Physical education and cookery should be removed from the syllabus so that children can
concentrate on wholly academic subjects.
I disagree with this opinion. Physical education is important teaching because there are many
things taught. Nowadays there is a big problem with obesity and children are not very health.
spending time watching TV and playing computer games. Physical education teaches children fit
and healthey. Also with physical education children play games like football. Football good for
children because children play in teams and learn how to play in teams. However, that is some
teach not so good in Physical education. Maybe children can choose sports. I think physical
Education more important than cookery. Cookery not very important children to learn in school.
Some mothers can teach cookery at home to children also some children can learn cookery at
home. Now on TV are many cookery programs children can watch and learn it. In my school was
no cookery and that was good for study. But there are good sides to cookery. People nowadays
have fast food and unhealth food. This gives children and people fat. Teaching cook can help
children. They will know health food and can teach vegetables and fruits. This might be usefull for
childrens.
In conclusion, I think non academic subjects are different. physical education is good for children
for helthy. Schools need to teach physical education and games like football to child. To teach
cookery isnot important for all child. Some schools teach cookery but some schools donâ€™t teach
cookery.",5,5,5,5,5

some people believe that non-academic subjects, such as physical education and cookery,

work.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays there is many pressures for young people to have good school result in academic
subjects. It is difficult for young people to get to university and for finding work after eductions. So
some people think that non academic subject are not as good for children to be learn at school and
they should only do academic subjects. I disagree with this statement and think non academic
subjects are also good for learning and developing children.
Firstly I think that school is not only a place for learning academic subjects and that other subjects
can be very useful at school. For example, when children learn physic education it is not only
academical learning but also other things. Also children can learn how can they be good health
and this is important for their life. Because many people have obesity and this is not a good
situation. If children learn physical education they would not have obesity as much.
Secondly I think that it is useful for school for teaching other things at school like cookery. I think
that this is a good skill for people to learn for the health and also there are many jobs with cookery.
For example, maybe you can open a restaurant or have difference cooking work. Therefore this is
a good situation for some children and is good to learn non academic subjects.
In conclusion I think that children can learn academic and non academic subjects and school and
this is the best thing for children. however, maybe there can be after school lessons or clubs for
children to learn skills and teachings that are non academic and be more academic in school time.",6,6,6,6,6

some people believe that non-academic subjects, such as physical education and cookery,

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Young people today are under pressure to do well at school and go on to higher education of find a
good job. For this reason many people think that non academic subjects are waste of time and that
schools should only focus on more academic subjects. I would disagree with this opinion and in
this essay will explain why.
Firstly there is a variety of skills are taught in non academic subjects that are essential for living. A
school should not only be focus on academic areas but should give children a range of skills. For
example children learn teamwork, discipline, leadership skills and how to solve problems with non
academic subjects.
Secondly, not all children want and need academic subjects. It is not important for everybody to go
higher education and have good result in school. There are some subject that teach children to be
more successful and find work easier. Subjects such like cookery and woodwork will be good for
some students and give possibilities for job opportunities as chefs or furniture makers, for example.
Finally, school can be very stressful and if all subjects are only very academic then it is bad for
children. Non academic subjects like physical education and music reduce their stress better than
only with academic subjects.
In conclusion I argue that non academic subjects are important because they can help children
learn skills, find work and reduce stress. A school should not only be focus on academic success
but teach lots of skills to children.",7,7,7,7,7

some people believe that non-academic subjects, such as physical education and cookery,

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Students nowadays are under a lot of pressure to achieve academical success in order to get into
a good university or secure a well paid job. For this reason some people argue that schools need
to focus on academic subjects and vocational subjects should therefore not taught at schools. I
would argue that while academic skills are important, schools need to teach a wide range of both
academic and more skills-based subjects.
Firstly, school should not only be about teaching academic skills but a wider range of life skills so
that students can join society when leaving school. Practical subjects can help to teach these skills
to students. For example, physical education teaches students how to work as part of a team and
also the importance of being healthy. Furthermore, if cookery is taught then students would learn a
great deal about health and nutrition.
Secondly, academic subjects are not of equal important for all students. There is the possibility of
including more practical non academic subjects on the syllabus like woodwork, textile design and
computing skills. If they study these subjects students will increase their employment prospects
and could help them to secure employment when they leave school. It is important to remember
that not all students will continue to higher education and school needs to enable those students to
find work.
Finally, too much pressure should not be put on school students. Taking part in non academic
subjects like art, music or drama gives students the opportunity to be creative. This could help
them to manage stress degrees and have more productive in other areas.
In conclusion I would argue that although academic subjects being important, this should not be
the only focus of a school syllabus. There are a number of benefits to teaching students non
academic subjects",8,8,8,8,8

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","As the internet becomes more popular, newspapers will soon become a thing of the past. I am
agree with this topic. The internet there is many informations about everything and the informations
is change all the time. In the newspapers there is not so much information and not easy to find
informations you want. There is not search function like on internet page. Also with the internet you
can do much more than read. Also play and watch. This is better for the people than newspapers.
Also newspapers can be very boring just stories and pictures. Pictures are sometimes good in the
newspapers but they donâ€™t have videos like the internet offer. Many newspapers are online
newspapers. People can read the same stories in newspapers and on the internet. On the internet
also write comments so newspapers are interaction. On the other hand. Newspapers can be on
computer and on smartphone. On computer maybe newpspaers are more better than internet
sometimes. Newspapers are small and you can go anyway with newspapers. maybe read
newspapers on train or bus. Internet you have to read on computer. But nowadays people have
smartphones. Smartphones can be anywhere with you all the time. Also smartphones can do many
more things like music and watch and play. You can read newspapers on smartphones. this is
good for convenient people. If you went anywhere you wil have lots of newspapers with you all the
time and you can read. In conclusion, i think that newspapers on smartphones is better than
newpapers old style but maybe newpapers are better for old people to read.",5,5,5,5,5
7,"As the internet becomes more popular, newspapers are becoming a thing of the past.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","Nowadays it is easy to read the news in many different ways than in the past. We can get lots of
informations from the internet that in the past would only be on the newspaper. Some people
believe that in the future there will not be newspapers. I agree with this statement.
Firstly getting informations from the internet are much more convenience than from a newspaper.
You can read news on the internet in anyplace and at anytime for example on your computer at
work or on your smartphone when you are on the bus. Reading a newspaper means that you will
need to go to the shop for buying a newspaper and be carry it with you. This is not as convenience
as reading on the internet.
Secondly news on the internet are much faster than news in the newspaper. News in the
newspaper can only be about yesterday or before. All newspapers are wrote the day before they
are sell in theshops. With the internet you can read as soon as a story happens. This way you get
news much more quicker.
Finally there are more stories on the internet for news. When I read a story on the internet I can
read different writers opinion about the news. i think this is good thing because you understand
more things about the news. In conclusion I believe that the internet is better for news than
newspapers many people who are buy newspapers now are older and for young people the
newspaper is not very important.",6,6,6,6,6
8,"As the internet becomes more popular, newspapers are becoming a thing of the past.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","Nowadays more and more people use the internet to read news stories. Because of this some
people argue that in the future there will no longer be newspapers because everyone will use the
internet. I think that there are advantages to using the internet but that there are still some
advantages to the newspapers so newspapers should stay.
There are advantages to read the news with your computer or smartphone. For example, this is
very convenient for some people. Furthermore it has changed the style of news and with a website
or news app there is often sound and video as well as written texts. Furthermore people can also
have interact more with news and discuss stories with other people.
Another advantage is that the internet news is much newer than the newspaper. If something
happens you read on the internet straight away the details and many people upload pictures to the
website. On the other hand, with the newspaper all the news are from the day before.
However, I do think there are some benefits to the newspaper. You can have bigger pictures to go
with a story than on a smartphone. Furthermore it is more comfortable to turn the pages on the
newsaper than have to always click on a new webpage. Additionally, many stories have more
detail.

In conclusions, because there are some benefits to the newspaper like pictures and ,more detail, I
think it would be bad if newspapers no longer existed and they will be here in future.",7,7,7,7,7
9,"As the internet becomes more popular, newspapers are becoming a thing of the past.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","It has become increasingly common for people to access the news electronically rather than with
traditional newspapers with many commentators suggest that this could mean the end for
newspapers. I would agree with this and think that in the future newspapers will disappear.
Firstly, news accessed online is much more interaction than in a newspaper. Readers can
comment on stories, and discussing items on message boards. Furthermore, many more
photographs can included with a story with many sites even give readers the opportunity to upload
their own photos and videos.
Secondly, news read on the internet are much more current than in a newspaper. It is possible for
readers to read about stories as they happen and watch the development. This is compared with
newspapers which only report on the previous days events. As a result, they seem increasingly
dated even before they are on sale.
Finally, online news offer readers much more choice and a more information. It is possible to read
the same story from a range of different sources on the internet. Some people suggest that this is
better than only reading the story in one newspaper as you can compare different ones and have
different viewpoints and the way stories are presented. This is compared with traditional
newspapers which might only report one side of the story.
In conclusion, I would argue that in the future it will become increasingly difficult to sell
newspapers. Because traditional newspapers will not be able to compete they will disappear.",8,8,8,8,8

traditional print media with many commentators suggesting that this could spell the end for
newspapers. I would agree with this and think that in the future newspapers will disappear.
First of all, news accessed online has much more interactivity than in a newspaper. Readers are
given the option of commenting on stories, and discussing items on message boards. Furthermore,
there is no limit to the number of photographs that could be included with a story with many sites
even giving readers the opportunity to upload their own photos and videos.

Another point to make is that news read on the internet is much more current than in a newspaper.
It is possible for readers to read about breaking stories and watch these stories develop, such as
the emergence of a war or hostage negotiation. This is compared with newspapers which only
report on the previous dayâ€™s events. As a result, they seem increasingly dated even before they hit
the newsstands.
Finally, online news offers readers much more choice and a wider range of information. It is
possible to read the same story from a range of different sources on the internet. For example, a
news article with a left-wing stance compared to one with a more right-wing agenda. Some people
suggest that this allows for a more balanced view than only reading the story in one newspaper as
you can compare different viewpoints and the way stories are presented. This is compared with
traditional newspapers which have much more editorial bias.
In conclusion, I would argue that in the future it will become increasingly difficult to sell
newspapers. The fact that online news offers more interaction and choice and is more up to date
means that traditional printed news will not be able to compete and will disappear.",9,9,9,9,9
11,"Many people in poor countries die from diseases that are curable because they cannot
afford the medication required.
Do you believe that drug companies should make their products available at reduced prices
in these countries?","Many people in poor countries die from diseases that are curable because they canâ€™t afford the
medication required. I think that this is not good situation. There are many countries with people
with no money and people die. They have the drug companies and the medications but the price is
too big for the poor people. In rich countries there is money and people live for long time. This is
not fair and good for the people. I think that rich countries should give medicines and money to the
poor countries and that then they will not die young and they can live for long time like us.
Many sickness is not in rich countries because of medicines and hospitals. We can build hospitals
with medicines in poor countries so that poor countries can be stopped the sickness. Example of
this is Bill Gates. Bill Gates gives much money and medicines to poor countries. Bill Gates is very
rich. If all rich people give money and medicines like Bill Gates then people in poor countries are
not die from diseases that are curable because they canâ€™t afford the medication. Another big
problem for undeveloped worlds countries is water. Everyone needs to walk a long time for water.
Maybe water comes from lakes and rivers and there is pollution there. Many people are dying from
diseases through bad water. We all need give money and help undeveloped countries people have
clean water and water not very far from home. Clean water and money all help people not die. Also
water makes food with farmers and food stops sickness too maybe.",5,5,5,5,5
12,"Many people in poor countries die from diseases that are curable because they cannot

Do you believe that drug companies should make their products available at reduced prices
in these countries?","There are many deaths in poor countries from diseases that rich countries can cure with expensive
medicines. Some people think that this is unfair and the medicines should be give to the poor

countries for a reduced price. I agree with this statement but also think that the responsibility is not
only drug companies.
Nowadays drug companies make a very big money with medicine for treating diseases. The
medicines are very expensive and in rich countries the government or health insurance pays these
medicines. However, in poor countries the government and people do not have the money to pay
for these medicines. I think that the drug companies should give medicines at a reduced price. HIV
and AIDS is a big problem in some African countries and drugs companies recently made
medication much cheaper. Because they made medication cheaper lots of people now do not die.
However, I think that it is not only a problem for drug companies. I think rich people and countries
should give money for poor countries so they can spend money on health.
In conclusion I believe that everyone needs a good health and people should have good health if
they poor or rich. It is not good to only have medicines for rich people and poor people are dying.
This is a big problem in some parts of the world and drug companies is bad to take all of the
money to make sick people health. Everybody needs medicine and poor people can have medicine
at a cheaper price then this is a good thing.",6,6,6,6,6
13,"Many people in poor countries die from diseases that are curable because they cannot

Do you believe that drug companies should make their products available at reduced prices

used to die. However, some of these medicines are expensive. Some people think that drugs
companies should sell these medicines to poor countries cheaply. I would agree with this and also
think there are other people who should help poor people.
Drug companies make a lot of profit through selling medicine to treat diseases and sick people. In
rich countries people and the government health care organisations can buy medicine and less
people are dying from diseases but in poor countries people do not access these medicines
because of the high cost. An example of this is HIV and AIDS. This is a big problem in some
African countries and recently drug companies sold medicine for much lower prices to these
countries so that less people die. I believe this is a good thing.
However, it is not just drug companies that should help poor people who are sick. Rich people and
governments should also help. For example Bill Gates recently spent a lot of money to help poor
people have access to medicine and treatments for their sickness. I think that all rich people should
be encouraged to do this and governments should also help.
In conclusion, I think that we have the resource so that we can help poor countries whoâ€™s people
die from diseases. Drugs companies should have lower prices for poor countries and not make so
much money from sick people. Rich people and governments should also help with charity.",7,7,7,7,7
14,"Many people in poor countries die from diseases that are curable because they cannot
afford the medication required.
Do you believe that drug companies should make their products available at reduced prices
in these countries?","The high cost of modern drug treatment means people in poorer countries are frequently unable to
benefit from it. I would argue that drug companies have a moral obligation to make their products
available at lower cost to developing countries and, whatâ€™s more, that rich governments and people
can help.
Over the last few decades there was a dramatic improvement in medicine that changed the
treatment of many life threatening diseases. Drug companies make money by treatment these
diseases. However, the fact that people in poor countries are unable to pay for these treatments
has created a very unequal situation.
I think that drug companies have a responsibility to be more ethical and that they have a
responsibility for addressing this inequality. They can do this by offering cheaper medicines in
countries that cannot afford to pay the full price. This means that everyone can get the drugs that
they need.
However, I also believe that there are others who have a role to play in giving poor people access
to drugs. For example, rich people could be encouraged to donate to charities to help developing
countries. An example of this was seen recently when Bill Gates spent a lot of money and set up
immunising projects in Africa.
In conclusion I would argue that it is immoral for people to die because of inequality, Access to
medicine should be universal and it is should be the responsibility of the richer companies,
individuals and governments to ensure that this is happening.",8,8,8,8,8

from them. I would argue that drug companies have a moral obligation to make their products

Over the last few decades there has been a dramatic improvement in medicine that has radically
changed the treatment of many life threatening diseases. While drug companies profit from treating
these diseases, the fact that people in poor countries are unable to pay for these treatments has
created an unacceptable degree of inequality in global access to health care.
I would argue that drug companies have a responsibility to be more ethical and to address this
inequality by offering cheaper generic versions of their medicines in countries that cannot afford to
pay the full price. This has recently been implemented with the treatment of HIV and AIDS in some
African countries, saving the lives of millions of people.
However, I also believe that there are others who have a role to play in giving poor people access
to drugs. For example, rich people could be encouraged to donate to charities to help developing
countries. An example of this was seen recently when Bill Gates spent vast sums of money to set
up immunisation projects in Africa. In addition to wealthy individuals, governments could also
donate aid and medical supplies.
In conclusion I would argue that it is immoral for people to be dying as a result of inequality. The
value of human life should be universal and it should be the responsibility of the richer companies,
individuals and governments to ensure that access to encompasses everyone.",9,9,9,9,9

this money on other things to benefit the nation.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","With all the troubles in the world today, money spent on space exploration is a complete waste.
The money could be better spent on other things. I am disagree with this statement. I think space
exploration is good thing. there is many informations in space exploration and people should be
interest in space. Maybe in the future there will be find new planets and maybe with water. I read in
recently the newspaper there maybe new planet with water and it is not so far away as we canâ€™t
maybe travel there in future spaceship. This is very excited because maybe there is life on water
planets. Also in the future maybe on our planet in the future there will be not good for living maybe
because of global warming there will be too much seas and ocerans but not water for drinking. If
we find a new planet maybe humans will live on the new planet but will need water planet for life.
On the other hand there arre some people who say that the money could be better spent on other
things. Maybe this is also true there are many poor people and poor countries in the world today.
Also in my country there is the crise economy and there are many people with no jobs space
exploration is very expensive and costs much money I think that some countries they cannot do
the space exploration they need spend their money on their country and help others. It is not good
thing for spending all the money on space. Some people need to eat and homeless people is
problem.",5,5,5,5,5

complete waste. Space exploration is too expensive. People think the money could be better spent
on different things. I agree with both sides of this statement. I think there are some advantages to
space travel but also other problems.

Firstly there are many things that we can know with space travel. There is a lot of new things that
we can learn about the universe and this is a good thing. maybe we can find new materials or even
explore new planets. This is good and in the future maybe we will need to know this informations.
However, the problem is space exploration is a very expensive.
There are many other problems in the world. Some people do not have houses and food and
clothes. Some countries are very rich and some countries are very poor.
This is not a good thing. If we save all of the money from space exploration then we will be able to
solve many of these problems and people would have better lives. This might be better for
everybody to live in a more equal world. For example in India money gets spend on space
exploration but there are many poor people with bad conditions for living. I think that this money
can be spent in a way more good for people.

is very expensive and there are other problems that some people think are more important so we
should not spend so much money on space exploration. I agree with this but think that we should
have more countries working together to share space exploration.
There are a number of problems facing the world today. Many people are rich but there are some
people who donâ€™t have accessable to education, healthcare, food water and somewhere where
they can live in. For this reason, to spend so much money on exploring space instead of to solve
problems on earth it is a bad thing and I believe that we should be helping people on earth first.
However, there are definitely advantage to explore space. Many science discoveries help people in
earth. For example we would find new materials and substation that are made to more medicine or
products.
One solution is to share resources with other countries. Lots of countries have there own space
centres and space programs. This is very expensive. If countries shared these resource then
space exploration would not cost as much money and we would do more for help people on our
planet.
in conclusion, I think that there are many problems on earth that we can solve and spending too
much money on space exploration is a bad thing. However, there are some advantages to going to
space and maybe countries can help eachother and share resources to go there.",7,7,7,7,7

space exploration.
There are a number of problems which they are still affecting the world today. Despite incredible
advancements in science and technology there are still billions of people who struggle with health,

On the other hand, we can learn a lot with the exploration of space. There is the possibility of

not make sense to only look at our planet.
One possibility of continue to explore the universe while improving the quality of life on earth is
through greater cooperation between countries. For example, a global space agency could be
started which it allows for countries to share their resources. This would enable countries to
allocate money more effectively.

21,"Many countries have compulsory military service for young men after they leave school. It
would be a good idea for all countries to adopt this system for men, and possibly for
women too.
Do you agree or disagree with this statement?","I am agree that all countries have military service for men. In my country there is military service for
all men and i think that this is good thing. It teaches men many new things and new skills that are
important for life. Also for young people it is fun doing the military service. I made many friends in
my country with military service. It is good for countries to have military and military needs people.
If military service is in the country then the army would have people and also young people would
learn new teaches. On the other hand i am not agree with military service for women. Nowadays
there are some women in military and this is not a problem for them. but I think that not all women
want to go in the military and not all women strong for military. Maybe women have other works or
can stay at home. I think that this is choose for women and compulsory military service is not a
good thing. Nowadays there is problems in many countries with behavour of young people. Young
people maybe no repect and maybe crime behavour. I think that military service is very hard and

more often criminal like behaviour and maybe violence. Military service teaches good behaviour. I

finish other study. It is not necessary for the women to go in my country. I believe that military
service does have benefits and that it can be compulsory.
Firstly military service can teach young people many new skills and give them more confident than
with no military service. Secondly, more crime and bad behaviour is a problem in many countries in
the world. Maybe if everybody did military service then we would not have this problem. Thirdly

there are many skills that can teach in military service like you learn to repair electricity things or
machines. Fourthly working with other people is something that is important in military and this is
useful for life.
On the other hand military service is not a good thing for everybody. Not everyone is physically
person and maybe not interested in these skills. For some people studying or starting work is more
value than military service.
Also some people do not like military and are peaceful people. They think that countries have too
much military and that young people should not be in military. Maybe this makes violence people.
In conclusion I believe that there are advantages to joining military service and it can teach many
things for young people but I donâ€™t think it is necessary for all people and many military should be
the choice of the people if they want to join or not.",6,6,6,6,6

People who are in favour of military service argue that it teaches young people many things. They
will learn discipline and how to be part of society. There are also other skills like teamwork and
leading people that are useful. People suggest many problems with behaviour and motivation
might solved with military service.
With regard to women and military service I would argue that there is no reason why are they not
part of it. Nowadays women are more equal than men and in many countries it is normal for
women to be in the military so I do not think that they canâ€™t do military service.
However, I think that the modern world is too interested in the military. We should encourage young
people to be peaceful people and have respect for other countries and other people. Some people
say that the military is not a good place for learning these skills.
In conclusion, I would argue that there are some advantages to military service and that it teaches

should be extend to all countries and possibly for both sexes. I would argue that although military
service is helpful for some it may not be a good idea for everybody.
One argument in favour of universal military service is that it will increase the skills of young
people. They will be force to face challenges and see the benefits of discipline and training. People
in favour also argue that it would help stop young people doing crime which is growing problem in
many countries.
On the other hand, critics argue that it leads to more violence for the youth and that not all
countries need to have so many people in the army. Furthermore the cost of maintaining such a
large number of people would be huge. Finally, they say it is unappropriate to make peaceful
people to go to the military.
There are alternatives to military service. Instead young people could take part in community
service programmes after leaving school. This would help to develop young people skills while they
are improving the community where they are living. Some people may also argue that this would
be more suitable for both men and women.

suggest that such â€˜national serviceâ€™ should be extended to all countries and possibly for both

everybody- and so should not be obligatory. However, I see no reason why anyone who wishes to
serve should be prevented from doing so, regardless of whether man or woman.
The argument most often advanced in favour of universal military service is that it increases the
skill set of young people, who are forced to face challenges and see the benefits of discipline and
training. Some people even go further in favour, and argue that obligatory military service would
help to tackle the youth disorder which is a growing problem in many Western countries. They also
say that if young people were to serve some time in the military in different parts of the country to
their home town, and with others who are also from different regions, then this camaraderie would
add to a sense of national unity and cohesion, and prove beneficial to society as a whole.
On the other hand, critics argue that these â€˜benefitsâ€™ are illusory. They say there is no real
advantage in merely wasting time which could be more usefully spent otherwise, that it leads to the
militarization of youth, and that not all countries need a large and expensive military presence
anyway. Finally, they question how appropriate it would be to force otherwise peaceful people into
the military.
There are alternatives to military service, though they are less common internationally. Instead
young people could take part in community service programmes after leaving school. This would
still help to develop various skills in the same manner as military service does, while making the
young people involved feel that they have an investment in their country and in improving the
community in which they live. I would argue that this kind of service would be far more suitable for
both men and women, as well as beneficial to society at large.

very expansive everyday on the underground I think. In my country the transports are not as many

then this is big problem. Maybe cheaper prices is good for students and young people. In germany
transports price for students is very cheap and this is good because students with less money than
salary job people.
On the other hand pollution a big problem and transports pollution very serious. In many cities
there are many cars and trucks that used to making the pollution. many people drive in cities to
work and visiting and are not taking public transports. Sometimes public transports are not
convenient for all the people and transports are very busy. Government need to make more

There are many people that drive cars in towns and cities and this is a big problem because of the
gridlocks and also the pollution that the cars emit. This fumes is really bad for the health. The
government needs to invest in public transport so that less people drive cars.

It is important that there is enough transport for large numbers of people and that the transport is
reliabil and doesnâ€™t break. The transport system in Tokyo is very good and lots of people use it.
Public transport prices is also a big problem. The price of the transport needs to be low so that
many people can pay it. If the price is more expensive or the same as the car then many people
would use the car because it is cheap. The government need to reduce prices, especially for
people with not many money to pay it. In Beijing the transport is very cheap for making people not
drive their cars.
In conclusion I agree that public transport is very important I think that transport pollution is a bad

agree with this and also suggest there are other steps we can be take.
Firstly, investment in public transport infrastructure helps solve the problem of traffic pollution. If
there was a better, more reliable and developed public transport system then less people will drive
their cars. If less people drove then there would be much less pollution. For example in Tokyo there
is a very good transport system and not many people drive.
Furthermore, if the government subsidized or reduced the price of public transport then more
people would use it. For example, many commuting people in England drive because there is not
much different to the cost of public transport so they choose private cars because they are more
convenient.
Furthermore, in addition to investment in public transport and lower prices we need to investing
money in cleaner cars. Nowadays we have the technology for create electric cars that donâ€™t make

that globalisation is unquestionable benefit to the planet and people who disagree stop progress. I
think this is true but there are some negative points to globalisation.
Globalisation has changed the way countries are interact with other countries. Because the way we
buy and sell is now very different and it is easy for a company to have business all over the world.

Morover many countries are more modern and we have simlar shops and brands everywhere.
people have access to good quality products everywhere. Also countries that were poor countries
in the past have these days the oportunity for getting money and improve lives of people. For
example is China. because of globalisation many people have better life than before and this
change is good.
On the other hand, globalisation has also caused problems. Because many countries now have the
same producs so many people and places look the same. If you go in any capital city in the world
people wearing the same cloth and there are lots of the same shops. However some people think
that this is bad and some traditional behaviours are been lost.
In conclusion I think that there are some sides to globalisation but the clothes people dress and the
shops they buy in are small. I was in Australia and the culture was different to my country. I think
the benefits and more money are more than the negatives.",6,6,6,6,6

positive and that any people who criticize globalisation are against progress. I agree with this up to
an extent but do believe that there are also some negative aspects for globalisation.
One of the biggest changes of globalisation is how countries do business. In other words, now it is
easier for countries to do business with other countries because international trade is now much
easier for both small and big companies. Because of this the lives of people have been changed a
lot. For example in China the economy is now much better than before. people now have better life
standards.
However, this change in business also causes problems. For example, companies now moved
around the world much easier. In other words if it is cheaper to make something in another country
then they move the factory. Therefore when the factory moves to another country then lots of
people lose jobs and work. As a result, this is a problem for countries that have high salaries.
Another problem is that globalisation has made everything more similar. All countries have the
same products now and people are wanting to wear the same clothes and act like similar ways to
other people. Many cities across the world look the same with the same shops. Traditional
behaviour has been lost.
In conclusion, there are certainly benefits to globalisation and countries have developed with lives
improved. However, I do think there are also negatives to it that we have to see",7,7,7,7,7

we make business and this has had a large impact in many countries. For some this has been
mostly positive. However, I believe there are two sides to the changes.
Nowadays it is much easier for countries to do business with them. This has resulted in a wider
range of services and products being available in nearly every country with many countries
benefitting a great deal. For example, in China, where many products are made in, the economy
has grown up enormously with a consequent rise in living standards.
However, there are also problems with this grow in international business. Possibly the biggest is
that is now much easier for companies to relocate. In other words, a company can now move its
factory to another country it will be cheaper to produce the goods. This is a big problem for
manufacturing workers in countries in which it is more expensive to produce goods and has
generally meant that people do not have safe employment.
Another drawback is do all countries benefit in the same way. Some countries find that they are
stuck in industries where there is only cheap labour in. Even in countries that have improved like
china, workers find themselves struggling to move from manufacturing jobs to better paid
service-based industries.

drive more further than electric cars and are also faster. In the future maybe more electric cars but
now oil cars are everywhere. Oil cars are using oil so we need find more oil. I have an oil car and
want to drive it continue with oil. In conclusion I think oil is necessary and it is good for money

One of the biggest problems with government free health care is the big cost. It is very expensive
for the government to pay for the health for all. The money for this needs to be raised with taxes.

The biggest problem with governments paying for healthcare is that it is expensive. This is
because the government has to pay a lot of money for healthcare and the money has to be rased
from people with tax. As a result many people do not support this idea as they think they are
paying too much tax for health services they do not use. Therefore this has caused much
disccussion in America recently. Before people in America used private health insurance.
Another method of paying for healthcare is to make it compulsary for people to pay for health
insurance. Moreover the government could check that people have money to pay for health
insurance.
The government has a responsibility to help poor people who can not pay for medical bills. in other
words. If somebody in a country is unhealthy and sick because they canâ€™t pay and everyone else
has access to treatment because they can pay then this shows a high level of inequaity and needs

Perhaps the biggest problem with government provided healthcare is the cost. Because an efficient
healthcare service costs a great deal of money to provide, governments need to raise extra funds
in order for covering costs. The only way of doing this is with collecting taxes by the population.
However, people who support a state funded system argue that everybody should have access to

from access to help and only the wealthy are able to benefit.

animals are dangerous for people. People kill the animals that are dangerous for people to live with
them and then some of animals should be extincted. People are killing the animals all over the

elephants this is for sport and is not very good for the animals. Also animals killed with guns and
then after species are sell for money. For example some medicine and products are made by

wear the animals after kill. I donâ€™t think that we need to wearing the animals and we can use the
clothes that are not animals. Also some animals are in the sea that are extincted and we use them
much. The problem is we all are using the animals and I think that we need stop to use the

situation for the planet. Although there are some solutions to this problem.

The biggest cause of the problem is humans. Humans kill too many animals for it is not sustainable
situation. One of the biggest ways of killing animals is with hunting. Many animals have been kill
with hunting. In some countries are laws about the hunting of animals and it is only for some
people and some times.
The problem is some people do the hunting even against the law and they are not caught for this.
There is animal poaching and this makes many people angry, with animals but they can be very
expensive when they are sold and gets lots of money for people. As a result, this is a big problems
for some endangered like tigers and rhinos. The solution to the problem is to have more money to
make checks and patrol in the wild where the animals living. If there were more serious punishes
for people that are killing animals then there will be less people that kill the animals. The animals
need more protection by humans to save the species from extinct.

indangered and are nearly extinct. This is a big problem for us as animals are needed for the
diverse life. I think that humans need to be responsible to the animals on earth and have to try
saving the animal species.
The biggest problem for animal species is certainly humans. We are kill animals for sport, for food,
for clothes and medicine. Due to the population of humans is growing, we are killing more and
more animals. One example of this is poaching indangered animals like the lion and rhino. Also
many species of fish is reduced because we use too many fish from the sea.
Another problem is the loss of habitaits for animals because of humans. When the population
grows more and more people live in towns and cities and they get larger. Many animals cannot live
near the cities and towns and there is not room left enough for the animals to live. An example of
this is the tiger in Asia.
Despite there are problems, there are also solutions to this problem. Firstly we need to control the
number of animals that are been killed by us. If people kill too many animals then there should
strict punishments. Also we need to protect the habitait of animals and we can have special areas,
parks and zoos for them to live safety.

The major threat to the survival of animal species is human activity. This is clear in the illegal
poaching of animals like tigers and rhinos who are hunted for sport and to sell on the black market.
Many species of fish are also the victims of overfishing.
However, we have also had a profound effect on animal life in the way we live. Population growth
over the last one hundred years has had a highly disastrous effect as cities and towns reduce
many animalâ€™s habitats. Also, in order to sustain our growing population, we need more and more
space for agriculture. This can be see in the destruction of the Amazon rainforest which has
endangered many species.
One final negative human influence can be seen in the changing environment. Climate change
threatens to change the planet too quickly which could have terrible results for many animals. A
clear example of this is the habitat of the polar bear which expects to be drastically reduce over the
next few decades.
Despite these problems there are some measures that could address the problem. Governments
need to share responsibility and have stricter punishments for animal hunters. We can also have
larger protected areas where human activity is limited. Perhaps the most difficult problem to
address is that of climate change which would mean change the way we live.

One final negative human influence can be seen in the changing environment. Animal ecosystems
are the result of millions of years of evolution whereby the animals have adapted to their
surroundings. Climate change threatens to alter these surroundings at an incredible rate which
could have cataclysmic results for many animals. A clear example of this is the habitat of the polar
bear which is expected to be drastically reduced over the next few decades.
Despite these problems there are some measures that could be taken to address the problem.

more severe punishments for animal poachers and hunters. We can also have larger protected
areas and national parks where human activity is limited. Perhaps the most difficult problem to
address is that of climate change which would mean a dramatic change in human behaviour.

This is good for some people and we can choose many products. The problem is small local shops
that are closing because of big shops. I think that small shops need saving.
There is more choice than in the past for shopping. For example there are out town shopping
centres and large supermarkets in every town. On the other hand many people buy online
shopping and this is very cheap for some people. Online shopping is also all day so people
working can shop at night for cheap.
However the problem is with small local shops. Small retailists do not have very much money and
also they buy not many products. This means that they sell small numbers and the price is high for
them to make money. Many people go large shopping and online because the price is high. As a
result in the future small shops will close because no customers are shopping there. This is
happening in my country. All shops are the same in the towns and small shops have to close
because of the crisis.
Only large supermarkets or retailists the same everywhere else can be open. I think that it is a
problem and if all shops close then towns would all be the same everywhere.
In conclusion, I think that people need to support local shops and buy there so that they stay open.
We all need to help to have the local community the way we want to live.",6,6,6,6,6

shops. How does this affect local communities? What could be done to improve this
situation?","Nowadays there is more choice for the consumers then ever in the past. Most small towns have a
large supermarket and you can buy any product on the internet with just the click. This might be
good for consumners but small local shops are competition and they have to close, in my opinion
we need to protect small shops by closing.
Large supermarkets have many stores all over the country. Because of this they are buying many
products for very cheap. Because they sell many products they can have very small profit of
margin on each item. Also many supermarkets have special offers and are very cheap. On, the
other hand, small local shops only have one shop and only sell little items. Due to the small
number they have to sell products more expensive and donâ€™t compete with the larger shops.
If all local shops donâ€™t compete then they have to close. This is very bad for local communities
because there are only large supermarkets and larger shops. This means that all places are the
same as everywhere else and also you can get the same products but not different local products.
I think that people should support the small shops and try and use them for shopping. But not only
the people can help. Maybe the government can help the small shops to stay open and have
cheap rent or cheap tax for them.

In conclusion, I think that if local shops close then local communities are not different or interesting.

products from around the world at very low prices. We are also able to buy anything from the

communities. I would suggest that we need to take measures to address this problem.
Large chain store are able to buy and sell a very large amount of products and, as a result they
can sell goods with a very small profit margin. Online retailers have comparatively low costs as
they do not have to keep a shop. This saving is then passed on to the customer in the form of low
prices. In comparison, smaller local shops have to sell products at a relative high price in order to
make a profit. Unable to compete, they often close.
With the loss of these shops are high streets and town centres become identical with the same
shops fronts and products. It has also been found that local shops generate more employment
than larger, chain stores.
What we need to do to encourage people to shop locally. This could be in the form of publicity
campaigns, which highlight the benefits to support local businesses. The government could also
offer tax breaks and incentives to local businesses so that they can compete with larger
companies.
To conclude, we can see a number of, mostly financial, reasons why smaller shops are unable to

smartphones like whatsapp and also facetime snapchat. These are things new on phones and
everybody communicate all the time all over the world and is free everybody. This is good.
On the other hand technology has driven people apart. maybe some people are with all their time
on the computer or with the mobil phone. This is not a good thing for people to make friends and
also to speak with someone in the physical. Sometimes when me and my friends are together in
restaurant or cafe everybody is using smartphones, they are sending messages or making tweets

them. This is true if you see friends together and some families now spend most of the time in
different rooms. In the past families were watching TV in one room together and often were
discussing things they saw.

instead of attending university.
Do the advantages of this situation outweigh the disadvantages?","Today, young people are choosing to start work instead of attending university. This have many
benifits but also has some disadvantages. I think both sides have good points, but get a job is
more useful for the people and the society because they can earn a lot of money and have many
experience.
Many young people want to work and not go to university so they can earn some money. For
example, my friend works in the shop to sell clothes. She makes money and she learns how can
she be a good seller because her boss teach her so many things. It is important to have an
experience so you can deal any thing. With experience, you can find better job or improve your
work. Sometimes company want workers with knowlege of work, not university. University donâ€™t
have any experience of true life, only you can learn about ideas and thinking. However the
university gives people the opportunity they can have a good job with high paid. All the companies
want workers who have good exams to show they are inteligent and good education. So if you try
to get a good job, you must go to university. For example, if you became a businessman, you will
need to studying economy so you understand the busness and money. Some people said you
donâ€™t need money to be happy, but is difficulty when you need to buy house and food. University
cost money, so it is better to earn money by work.",5,5,5,5,5

sides have good points, but getting a job is more useful for the person and the society.
However, many young people want to work and not go to university so they can earn some money
and also get training for their future career. For example, many companies have internship which

young people can do. It gives them a chance to learn about a career. Also, these people can take
the knowlege that they get from the job to benifit other people in the society. Many young people at
university do not work hard, they just play video games or go out with friends, so it is better they
start working and maybe they can go to university later. Internship needs hard-working, so they
learn to be serious and deal with other coworkers in their job. They can be fired if they are not
serious, and they will lose their job.
The university gives people more opportunities to choose a good career, so they enjoy their job,
and have high salary. This education teaches them all about subjects like economics, but this is not
so necessary for a good workers. You can not know all about a job if you have only study.
Therefore in my opinion, it is better for young people to start work, but they need to have a good
education so they can be a good worker. University gives people opportunities to improve they
knowlege about subjects. So both sides have advantages.",6,6,6,6,6

University gives people more opportunities to choose a good career, so they feel more satisfied by
their job, have high salaries and the possibility for improve their education with Masterâ€™s degree in
the future. Hopefully, they will also teach other young people so that the country remains success
in the future. Also, many workers need to have a degree on their CV when they apply to a job.
However, several young people also take advantage of opportunities to gain valuable experience in
the workplace as soon as possible. This mean they can earn some money and also get training for
their future career. For example, many companies offer internship or apprenticeship, such as
engineering companies where young people can work to learn, instead of study. Sometimes the
things we learn from real life are more important than books.
Furthermore, experience from work is very useful. You can have a more fun life in the office,
meeting and going out with colleagues is a good way to improve your sociality. Many people meet
their friends from their job, but only have a few friends from the university. Often, workplaces have
many events, like parties, which may be fun for young people.

changing as many of them are choosing do training in the workplace. This has numerous benefits
for both the society and the young, though some drawbacks also exist.
Higher education opens a number of doors to graduates, who will have more opportunities as life
develops, so they feel more satisfied by their profession, have high salaries and the possibility for
improve their education with Masterâ€™s degree in the future. This means they will have a higher
quality life, and will be able to save money for the future. Furthermore, in educating themselves,
many people can feel a sense of satisfaction and personal development.
However, a huge advantage for youngsters making the decision to enter the workplace nowadays
is in the range of apprenticeship and training opportunities available. These allow young workers to
earn enough money and recieve on-the-job training while attending college courses and getting
qualifications. In countries where this apprenticeships are not available, young people may be able
to pay their own part-time studies by earning a salary. For example, they might chose to gain
experience working as part of a team in a convenience store or cafe, allowing them to learn on the
job and save some money.
Furthermore, the experience that young people receive when working is unvaluable in the real
world of work. That is to say, education is good for understanding in general, but you cannot be
such good worker in an office environment with only knowledge from books. Indeed, our society
needs people who know how to do things, not just talk about them.
In conclusion, there are many advantages of a traditionally university education, but I believe the
benefits of more modern options outweigh them, as they are open to all and enable young people
to gain awareness and experience necessary to earn a good salary from their chosen career.",8,8,8,8,8

Tertiary education opens a number of doors to graduates, who tend to have more opportunities as
life develops, leading to them potentially feeling more fulfilled by their profession, earning higher
salaries and the possibility to further their education through Masterâ€™s degrees or Doctorates in the
future. Not only can the benefits be felt in increased earning power but also in terms of personal
development, with graduates having been proved to lead healthier, more fulfilled lives.
However, a huge advantage for youngsters making the decision to enter the workplace nowadays
lies in the diverse range of apprenticeships and vocational training opportunities available. These
allow young workers to earn a modest living and receive on-the-job training while attending college
courses and earning recognised qualifications. In countries in which such apprenticeships are not
available, young people may be able to fund their own part-time studies by earning a salary. For
example, the huge increase in the number of call centres in up-and-coming countries could provide
a youngster with a stable job while undertaking training in other areas, or within the field of
technology or marketing.
Furthermore, organisations which can impart working knowledge to their young workers, moulding
and preparing them for future careers, greatly benefit firms and individuals, who will not need to
gain practical skills after graduating. Having received this on-the-job training, they are then in a
position to further their education if they choose, or begin to earn a salary as a professional in their
field.
In conclusion, although the merits of a traditional university education are numerous, I believe the
benefits of more modern options outweigh them, as they are open to all and enable young people
to gain both the theoretical and practical knowledge necessary to earn a good salary from their

animals are suffer and dead so that make ups safer so that people look good., This is not good for

on animals. This would be better. There are different animals for to be experiment. Sometimees
there are monkeys and sometimes there are dogs and sometimes there are rats and small ones. I
think small animals better experimentations than big animals. Big animals have big brains and so
not nice for experimentations like human brains but rats and small ones have small brains so
experimentations are better. If I am know medicines is test on animals then I know medicines safe.

success. one type of success is work and jobs. For some people the most important success is
money and salary with your job. Some people think that success is have a high salary you are
success person. With high money you can buy everything you want. You have nice house and you
have nice clothes and car. This is success with many people want. I do not think this is success
job. Maybe you have high salary but maybe you also have stress job that s very bored for life. if
your life is bored and you hate your works everyday then you not success person in my opinion.
Maybe you can have success job with lower salary maybe you are nurse you can be success if yu
help lots of people and also you are very good in your job some nurses do very good things and
many people remember nurses work. Other jobs you can be success are teacher. Teacher is very
important job for all and spend time teaching people is success life in my opinion.
On the other hand there is also success in other things outside work. Maybe you have success
with family. If you are marry and you have children and everyone in family is happy and healthy

person. The job is not as important as the salary. Other people think that success in job is what you
do.

If you do your job very well then it is a success. For example a teacher might help lots of students
to get good exams and have good results at school then the teacher is success but some people
say the salary is small. I think if you enjoy your working then you are success in your job.

happily and also family that are happy then this is also success. Success is not only your job but
also personal feelings.
In conclusion I think that success is a mixture of different things and success it is different for other
people. I think that if you have a good job that is enjoyable for you then this is a success. Also if
you have a good family then this is success. I think if your job is good enough to have the money
you need for family then this is the best.",6,6,6,6,6

What can success mean to different people?
What is your view of success?","The majority of people try to achieve success in their lives. However, people view success in very
different ways. For some it relates to work and for other people success is about your personal life
and achievements. In this essay I will consider all of these before giving my opinion.
With success at work there are many different viewpoints. For some people success is measured
by how big your salary is. If you are more money then you are more successfully person. However,
for other people success at work is achieving things which are different to money. For example a
teacher might help people to learn the things they need for life. Or if you are a creative person and
produce something you are very pride with. This is successful for some people.
Other people see success more to do with personal life than work and see success as being with
family. If you have a good family with a marriage and have children who are happy and good
people then this is a success for some people. Others feel it a success when they have kind
friends and a good sociable life.
Finally there are others who see success as achieving goals and ambitions. If they complete these
goals then they are success.
In my opinion success is different for every person. I think that it should be a mix of all of the things
above. If you have an enjoying job and a happy life then you are a success.",7,7,7,7,7

What is your view of success?","Many people work hard to have a successful life. However the meaning of success is not a clear
one and it can be different things to different people. This essay will consider success about the
workplace, family, and finally personal achievements.
For many people, success is related with their career. For some people, this is measured in the
how high their salary is; if they earn more than someone else they will be more successful.
However, others do not have this view and say that if you are working in a job that you do not enjoy
then you cannot be a successful, regardless of your income. Instead you need to consider job
satisfaction and what you achieve in the job. For example, teachers who have helped many people
achieve their goals or other workers who have successfully finished a project or other target that
they have.
Another important part of success maybe the family. Raising up and providing for a family is an
important part of life for many people. In this case success can be measured in how satisfied are
your family with close bonds between family members being more important than money.
A final aspect is personal achievement. We all have goals and dreams which we would like to be
achieved. These dreams are very diverse and vary from person to person. For example, some
people may wish to travel the world and others compete in a marathon, or write a book. By
achieving these things we are accomplishing targets and would be feeling very successful.
In conclusion, people may see success in their professional personal. I would argue that success is
individual for everybody but that for me, it is a mix of all of the different things described above.",8,8,8,8,8

86,"In the last decade, there has been a great increase in global air travel.
What do you think are the reasons for this and do you think it is a good thing?","In the last decade there has been a great increase in the amount of global air travel. There are
many people who like travel and want to see new place. I think that more people now travel in the
past on the airplanes. I think maybe more people have money so they go on holiday with the
airplane more than in the past. Also now can pay your travel by credit card and not need save
money before you get ticket. in the past maybe stay at home for holiday and not travel to other
countries. I thin travel is a good thing for experience new culture and also see new place. I have
been to many places for travel and this is good.
And there are also more planes nowadays with more places and choose. In the past maybe not
many airlines and smaller choose for people to go to other countries. When i go to the airport I can
see many flights leaving that day to all over the world at all the time in the day so I can choose go
anywhere is very easy. Also i can be book a ticket for airplane on the internet. It is very quick and
easy for booking tickets on websites. Websites search many places and find good price and then
you can buy tickets just at home. I think that in the past it was more difficult for buying tickets for
airplane. people must go to travel agent and maybe not get the best price. this is not as
convenient. Travelling by plane is convenient for me and it is the fastest.",5,5,5,5,5
87,"In the last decade, there has been a great increase in global air travel.
What do you think are the reasons for this and do you think it is a good thing?","Over the last ten years people are travelling with plane more and more. Reasons for this are
mostly cost, convenient and wanting to travel more but there are some problems with more flights.
One of the biggest reasons for more people travelling with plane is the cheap cost. Nowdays there
are many airlines budget that give people cheap ticket to fly to different countrys. In the past it was
more expensive to travel and only rich people could go on many holidays. Now compays have
competiting with other companies to get customers. Another reason is convenient. It is now very
easy to find a flight and book a ticket on the internet. You can use a price search website to have a

good deal. Also you can pay with credit card so you donâ€™t have to save all the money before you
buy tickets.
In the past people used to had to go to a travel agent or over the telephone. There are also many
more flights to choose from. in the airport you can see departure menu with many flight option to all
over the world.
Finally many people have travel for hobby now. On the internet there are many travel websites and
on the television many travel programmes. People have more information about other countries
and want to go there.
in conclusion, as I wrote above there are different reasons for more people travelling. I think that
travel is good and there are many advantages. however, more flights are also bad.",6,6,6,6,6
88,"In the last decade, there has been a great increase in global air travel.
What do you think are the reasons for this and do you think it is a good thing?","There has been a great increase in the number of international flight in the last decade. i believe
that there are a number of reasons for this because of cost, convenience and improved routes.
However, there are some disadvantages with the environment.
There are a number of reasons for more people to fly. Firstly, Nowadays there are many low price,
budget airlines that offer flights for much more cheaper than before. Therefore, this competition
has meant that other airlines also give cheaper tickets. Secondly, it is much more convenience to
book a ticket and fly now. You can surf the internet to find the best deal and book online. In the past
you would had to go to a agency travel. Furthermore with an improved service there are more
international airports to choose from than before.
These changes mean that more people have the oportunity to travel. Before it was only for people
with money but now people have the oportunity to see more of the world and experience new
things. I think that this is a good thing as it broadens people mind and means people meet other
cultures easier
Although, the biggest problem with more flights is the enviromental impact. Flying is one of the
biggest causes of global warming as planes use a lot of fuel that produces greenhouse gasses. In
addition, planes cause noise pollution. This is a serious problem for people who live near busy
airports.
In conclude, more people are flying because it is cheap and easier than in the past. Although there
are some environmental problems I believe that this is a good thing.",7,7,7,7,7
89,"In the last decade, there has been a great increase in global air travel.
What do you think are the reasons for this and do you think it is a good thing?","Over the last few years the number of air passengers has increased dramatically. There are a
number of reasons for this increase but also some benefits. However, it has also caused some
problems with regards to the environment.
There are three main reasons for the growth in air travel and they are reduced costs, more
convenient and an improved network. About the cost, there are now many buget airlines offering
low cost flights. This has meant that other airlines lowered their fares in order to competition. Also
people are now able to book their own flights online instead of through a travel agent, ensures that
they get the best price. Finally there are more international airports than ever before. This means
that it is much easier to travel than it was use to be.
Generally, these changes have been mostly positive for people. Air travel is no longer only for the
rich people and more people have been offered the chance to experience new cultures and
experience new things. Additionally, more families are able to travel abroad for holidays than in the
past.
Despite these benefits for people, air travel has had a negative influence on the environment. This
is mostly because air fuel produces a large number of greenhouse gasses which in turn cause
climate change.
In conclusion, it is evident that there are a number of reasons for the increase in air travel and that
this rise has been largely beneficial on an individual level. However, the environmental impact of air
travel needs careful consideration.",8,8,8,8,8
